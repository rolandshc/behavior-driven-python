# behavior-driven-python
This repository is forked from [behavior-driven-python](https://github.com/AndyLPK247/behavior-driven-python) by [AndyLPK247(https://github.com/AndyLPK247/behavior-driven-python)

This is a project for demostrating the integration of pytest, pytest-bdd, circleCI and jira. 
* [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd)
* [circleCI](https://circleci.com/)
* [jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)


The example projects (in the subdirectories)
include full tests and documentation.

The example projects share the `cucumbers.py` module,
which contains a simple *CucumberBasket* class for unit testing.
